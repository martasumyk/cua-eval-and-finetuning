## Overview

Computer Use Agents (CUAs) represent an emerging Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concept in which users delegate high-level goals to autonomous agents that perceive, reason, and act directly within desktop environments (see example in the image below). A core challenge is that CUAs frequently misidentify whether a task has been completed, leading to false positives and false negatives that undermine reliability in real-world deployment. This thesis investigates the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as autonomous evaluators of CUA task completion. A VLM-based evaluator is used to judge task success from visual observations of the interface, and its feedback is modeled as a noisy reward signal characterized by false-positive and false-negative errors. To address the resulting learning bias, the thesis proposes a noise-corrected reward estimator and integrates it into a reinforcement-learning fine-tuning framework.

### Research Questions

- **RQ1:** Can Vision-Language Models (VLMs) serve as effective autonomous evaluators of task completion for computer-use agents operating in real-world desktop environments?
- **RQ2:** How can noisy autonomous evaluation signals be incorporated as reward feedback for reinforcement learning fine-tuning of CUAs in a statistically principled and robust manner?

### Contributions 

This thesis makes the following contributions:

- **Autonomous task completion evaluation.** We study the use of VLMs as autonomous evaluators for assessing task completion of computer-use agents based solely on visual observations of GUI states, without access to ground-truth success labels or application-specific instrumentation.

- **Problem formulation with noisy feedback.** We formalize task completion evaluation for desktop CUAs as a noisy binary feedback problem, explicitly modeling false positive and false negative errors in autonomous evaluator outputs. This formulation elevates task completion assessment from a heuristic post-processing step to a first-class learning problem.

- **Noise-aware reward design for reinforcement learning.** We propose a statistically grounded approach for incorporating noisy autonomous evaluation signals as reward feedback for reinforcement learning fine-tuning, enabling learning to remain robust despite evaluator uncertainty.

- **End-to-end fine-tuning framework.** We integrate autonomous task evaluation and noise-aware reward correction into a standard policy-gradient reinforcement learning pipeline, enabling end-to-end fine-tuning of computer-use agents without manual annotations, hand-crafted reward functions, or task-specific APIs.

## Data

The dataset is available at Zenodo [link placeholder].

The dataset description is done by the [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) methodology and is available [here](https://github.com/martasumyk/cua-eval-and-finetuning/blob/main/datasheet.md).


## Autonomous Evaluators

The autonomous evaluator is a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that judges whether a CUA has successfully completed a given task, based solely on a screenshot of the final GUI state and the original task description, without access to ground-truth labels or application-specific instrumentation.

Given a task instruction and a final screenshot $s_{i,n}$, the evaluator produces a binary completion signal:

$$\tilde{r}_i = \text{Evaluator}(s_{i,n}, \text{task}) \in \{0, 1\}$$

Because VLM-based evaluators are imperfect, this signal is modeled as **noisy**, characterized by two error rates: False Positive and False Negative.

The `evaluators/` directory contains implementations for both proprietary and open-source evaluators. Each evaluator shares a common interface: it receives a task string and a screenshot (as a base64-encoded image) and returns a dict with `completed` (0 or 1) and `justification` (a short text explanation).


## Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning
The Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning framework closes the loop between autonomous evaluation and agent improvement. The agent interacts with a real desktop environment, producing trajectories of screenshots and actions. After each episode, the final screenshot $s_{i,n}$ is passed to the autonomous evaluator, which produces a noisy binary reward $\tilde{r}_i$. A noise-aware correction converts this into a calibrated reward $\hat{r}_i = f(\tilde{r}_i)$, which is then used to update the agent's policy via PPO:

$$\theta \leftarrow \theta + \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$$


Raw evaluator rewards are corrected using an estimator that accounts for the evaluator's false positive and false negative rates.

where $p$ is the prior probability of task success. This correction reduces systematic bias introduced by evaluator noise and stabilizes the PPO update.

## Publications and Intermediate Projects

This thesis builds on two intermediate research projects focused on autonomous evaluation and auditing for Computer Use Agents.

**Accepted at [AAAI 2026 Workshop on Trust and Control in Agentic AI (TrustAgent)](https://trustagenticai.github.io/AAAI2026/)**

This project studies whether Vision-Language Models can judge task completion for Computer Use Agents directly from screenshots and task descriptions. It introduces a dataset of 1,260 human-labeled tasks across 42 built-in macOS applications and shows that evaluator feedback can improve agent reliability and self-correction.
